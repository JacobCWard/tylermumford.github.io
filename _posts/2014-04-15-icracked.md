### Now an iTech fixing iPhones & iPads

I've started repairing broken screens in my local area; iOS devices and some others are welcome! As part of iCracked's worldwide network of technicians, I have access to top-quality parts and tools. The best part is that it's a mobile business &em; if you live or work near Ogden, Utah, I'll come directly to you and fix your device on the spot! (Unless the repair requires heat. That takes more time, so I have to bring it in and then back to you the next day.)

Here's my [iTech info page](https://www.icracked.com/itech/44760). If you're in Ogden, contact me directly (see below). Otherwise, request a repair through iCracked.com and someone else will take care of you.
