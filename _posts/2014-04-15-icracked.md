### Now an iTech fixing iPhones & iPads

*Update:* I'm [no longer]({% post_url 2015-03-24-itech-no-more %}) fixing mobile devices.

I've started repairing broken screens in my local area; iOS devices and some others are welcome! As part of iCracked's worldwide network of technicians, I have access to top-quality parts and tools. The best part is that it's a mobile business &mdash; if you live or work nearby, I'll come directly to you and fix your device on the spot! (Unless the repair requires heat. That takes more time, so I have to bring it in and then back to you the next day.)
