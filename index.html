<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>
	My name is Tyler Wayne, and I'm a coder. I make computer programs, and other complicated things. That's why I created Code Haven &mdash; to have a place to publish my code and the code of others.
	All of my code is written in my spare time, with the exception of a few school assignments. Programming is what I love to do, because I believe that it's an art form.

<h3>A Listing of my Work</h3>

	<dt><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ekdgbodaoampohmhmecigaomnjppbplb" target="_blank">Goodness</a></dt>
	<dd>
	is my most successful program. It's a Chrome extension that provides a way to filter the Internet based on terms entirely user-defined. Designed to help people overcome pornography addictions, its ultimate goal is to place and keep the user in a positive, spiritual frame of mind.

	<dt><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gddhafhbmmbafbfdkgpjfcdkkeifjgga" target="_blank">MLIx&#772;</a></dt>
	<dd>
	is a good way to demonstrate part of my personality, and one reason why I choose to code. <a href="http://mylifeisaverage.com" target="_blank">My Life Is Average</a> is a website where people share interesting stories about their lives, similar to Twitter, but much more humorous. One day, I had the idea to improve the functionality and visual appeal of the site. So I made this Chrome extension to do just that.

	<dt><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gdbjnkjeipkapabcodafgjgpdnjhgcbc" target="_blank">Blue Ray</a></dt>
	<dd>
	showcases another one of my skills. In addition to programming, I'm also enthusiastic about design work, so I threw this minimalistic Google Chrome theme together. I think it looks pretty good. Anyway, you've probably noticed that almost all of my work is for Chrome, right? Well, that's because anyone who can write web pages with JavaScript can easily learn <a href="http://http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html">how to make Chrome extensions</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=20975.0" target="_blank">SubDiv</a></dt>
	<dd>
	was my first real program for Windows. I submitted it as part of the <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=21276.0" target="_blank">NANY 2010 challenge</a> on <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com" target="_blank">DonationCoder.com</a> &mdash; a site I highly recommend. For such a small program, it did better than I thought it would (after I fixed an inconvenient bug).
	</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="https://github.com/tylerwayne/UberType/wiki/Instructions" target="_blank">&Uuml;berType</a></dt>
	<dd>
	is last, but certainly not least. I've spent much of the past six years learning German, and I found that umlaut characters are not easy to create on an English keyboard. This Windows program lets you type &Auml;, &Ouml;, &Uuml;, and &szlig; very easily, without memorizing tricky keyboard shortcut combinations.

	works have I made, that are not on this page, yes. Follow the link, and find them you will.
	</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="about.html#conceptual">Even More...</a></dt>
	<dd>
	On occasion, a nasty habit shows up where I get a great idea, start working on it, and then find another great idea and abondon the first idea to the bit bucket. Here you'll find a list of them. The top few may or may not get ressurrected later on, depending on whether or not I have a time machine.
