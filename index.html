<h3 id='about_me'>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Tyler Wayne, and I&#8217;m a coder. I make computer programs and other complicated things. That&#8217;s why I created Code Haven — to have a place to talk about my code and the code of others.</p>

<p>All of my published code is written in my spare time and freely available. Visit the <a href='links.html'>Links</a> page for a list. I hope to make money eventually, but for now I&#8217;m content to simply express myself. (Whoo, that sounds artsy-fartsy.) But honestly, I believe programming is an art, and I fancy myself a bit nobler for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&#8220;The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs.&#8221;</em> — Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason</p>
