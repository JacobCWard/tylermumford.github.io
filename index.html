    <h1>Hey. You've found Code Haven.</h1>
    
    <p>It doesn't really exist yet, though. So congratulations on finding something that doesn't exist. Up next:  waiting patiently until it does.</p>
    
    <p>Eventually, it's going to have some cool features, like information about all of my projects, where to get some neat stuff, and awesome tips for using your computer. I might even launch a small business from here. Once it exists, of course.</p>
    
    <p>Have fun browsing the rest of the Internet, which &mdash; thankfully &mdash; does exist.</p>
