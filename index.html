<h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
    	Hello. My name is Tyler Wayne, and I will be your host for this website. I'm the programmer responsible for the projects here on Code Haven. I do most of my programming in my spare time, because it's what I love to do.
    </p>

<h3>Land of the Free</h3>
	<p>
        Every program I've ever created will always been free. I don't think I need to be paid for doing something that I love (not yet, anyway). Another reason for freedom is the fact that programs should be helpful, and emptying your wallet isn't very much of a help.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of my programs are also open source, which means that anyone can use them, study them, or even duplicate and change them. It's free as in "free speech," not just "free food." If you want to check out the source code, just head over to <a href="http://github.com/tylerwayne" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can work alone or suggest changes to any of my programs; keep it to yourself or share it with the world. Your call.
    </p>
