        <p>It's understandable that you might be confused. Confusion happens a lot around me. So does combustion, but that's not something I like to talk about.<br />
        I'll do my best to answer your questions.</p>

    <h3><em>What is this place?</em></h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It's my website. A place for me to do what I want. I get to impart information, publish programs, and share stuff.</p>

    <h3><em>Why am I here?</em></h3>
    <blockquote> <!-- Blockquote used for indentation -->
        <strong>&bull; Reason 1:  A Chrome Extension</strong>
        <p>Odds are good that you came here because you seek information about one of my extensions for Google Chrome. <strong>Goodness</strong> is the most popular right now, but there's also <strong>MLIx&#772;</strong> and the soon-to-be-released <strong><a>Shelves</a></strong>. No, I'm not talking about IKEA.</p>
        
        <strong>&bull;  Reason 2:  Checkin' me out</strong>
        <p>Since I'm not exactly at the top of any search results, you're probably someone who has heard of me, the human&#40;oid&#41; Tyler Wayne. If you have, hi! You're probably here because I know you in real life and mentioned that I have a website here. Of course, if you're a potential employer, I invite you to look over my work and portfolio to see that I am a skilled and tasteful web developer.</p>
        
        <strong>&bull;  Reason 3:  </strong>
        <p>You use StumbleUpon, in which case I mean nothing to you whatsoever.</p>
