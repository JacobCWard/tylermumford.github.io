<h2>About Me</h2>
    
<h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>
        Though I originally wanted to be an engineer, I learned through the help of my friends that I loved programming. I enjoy the problem-solving challenges that coding presents, and I also take pleasure in the feeling of capturing my schemes and ideas by permanently recording them in code.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's also why I love photography and writing. In a word, you could describe me as creative. Not many programmers enjoy writing prose (or poetry, for that matter), but I find it exciting and fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        I speak English and German; I write JS, CSS, HTML, PHP, and C++; and I can read any programming language you put in front of me. <small>(So far.)</small>
    </p>

<h3>My Previous Work</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ekdgbodaoampohmhmecigaomnjppbplb" target="_blank">Goodness</a></dt>
        <dd>
            is my most successful program. It's a Chrome extension that provides a way to filter the Internet based on terms entirely user-defined. Designed to help people overcome pornography addictions, its ultimate goal is to place and keep the user in a positive, spiritual frame of mind.

        <dd>
            is a good way to demonstrate part of my personality, and one reason why I choose to code. <a href="http://mylifeisaverage.com" target="_blank">My Life Is Average</a> is a website where people share interesting stories about their lives, similar to Twitter, but much more humorous. One day, I had the idea to improve the functionality and visual appeal of the site. So I made this Chrome extension to do just that.
        </dd>
        
        <dt><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gdbjnkjeipkapabcodafgjgpdnjhgcbc" target="_blank">Blue Ray</a></dt>
        <dd>
            showcases another one of my skills. In addition to programming, I'm also enthusiastic about design work, so I threw this minimalistic Google Chrome theme together. I think it looks pretty good. Anyway, you've probably noticed that almost all of my work is for Chrome, right? Well, that's because anyone who can write web pages with JavaScript can easily learn <a href="http://http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html">how to make Chrome extensions</a>.
        </dd>
        
        <dt><a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=20975.0" target="_blank">SubDiv</a></dt>
        <dd>
            was my first real program for Windows. I submitted it as part of the <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=21276.0" target="_blank">NANY 2010 challenge</a> on <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com" target="_blank">DonationCoder.com</a> &mdash; a site I highly recommend. For such a small program, it did better than I thought it would (after I fixed an inconvenient bug).
        </dd>
        
        <dt><a href="https://github.com/tylerwayne/UberType/wiki/Instructions" target="_blank">&Uuml;berType</a></dt>
        <dd>
            is last, but certainly not least. I've spent much of the past six years learning German, and I found that umlaut characters are not easy to create on an English keyboard. This Windows program lets you type &Auml;, &Ouml;, &Uuml;, and &szlig; very easily, without memorizing tricky keyboard shortcut combinations.
        </dd>
        
        <dt><a href="about.html#more">More</a></dt>
        <dd>
            works have I made, that are not on this page, yes. Follow the link, and find them you will.

            On occasion, a nasty habit shows up where I get a great idea, start working on it, and then find another great idea and abondon the first idea to the bit bucket. Here you'll find a list of them. The top few may or may not get ressurrected later on, depending on whether or not I have a time machine.
