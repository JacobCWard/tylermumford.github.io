<h2>About this Base</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
    Hello. My name is Tyler Wayne, and I will be your host for this website. I'm the coder responsible for the products featured here on Code Haven. I do all of this programming in my spare time, because it's what I love to do. Programming is problem solving, so when I see a problem that can be solved with a program, I do it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>My Work</h3>
    <p>
    Every program I've ever created has always been free. I don't think I need to be paid for doing something that I love so much. Another reason for freedom is the fact that programs should be helpful, and emptying your wallet isn't very much of a help.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most of my programs are also open source, which means that anyone can use them, study them, or even duplicate and change them. It's free as in "free speech," not just "free food." If you want to check out the source code, just head over to GitHub. You can work alone or suggest changes to any of my programs; keep it to yourself or share it with the world. Your call.
    </p>
    <p>
    My programs that are stable enough for public use are listed on the <a href="index.html">home page</a>, but here is a more <del>thorough</del> <ins>complete</ins> listing of the software I've produced.

               Rather than adding a definition list here, I modified the homepage to include one. I feel this decision makes both pages better.

    <h3>Code Haven <small>(the website itself)</small></h3>
    <p>
    I'm sure you can tell by yourself, but Code Haven is a wee bit dull right now. There's no stylesheet powering these pages; it's nothing more than <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML 1.0</acronym>. I'll be gradually improving it, so there is <em>some</em> good news.
    </p>
    <p>
    As far as the content of the site goes, there really isn't any right now. Pretty soon though, there will be information and screenshots of my Chrome extensions and programs, as well as interesting things that I find share-worthy.
