<p>
There are several ways to tell me something, and all of them are valid. Feel free to just use the easiest method for you. Depending on what you want to say, however, one method might be more effective than the others. 
</p>

<p>Recommendations:</p>
<dl>
	<dt><strong>No matter what</strong> you want to do...</dt>
	<dd>You can do it by emailing me at <a href="mailto:tyler.wayne.dev@gmail.com">tyler.wayne.dev@gmail.com</a>. I'll respond as fast as I can, and I'll make sure that I hear whatever it is that you have to say.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Submitting</strong> a bug report...</dt>
	<dd>Is best done through the issue tracking system of the appropriate <a href="http://github.com/tylerwayne">GitHub</a> project (repository). These allow me to categorize issues effectively, even in large numbers. They are publicly visible, which means that others besides me have the ability to help out.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Suggesting</strong> a feature...</dt>
	<dd>Is also a good reason to use the issue trackers mentioned above. The system can track features, bugs, version goals &mdash; just about everything that can be categorized (and then some).</dd>
	<dt><strong>Praising/complimenting</strong> my work...</dt>
	<dd>If you've got a glowing review, send that to the appropriate <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/Tyler%20Wayne">Chrome Web Store</a> page for the program. If there is no Web Store page, just email it to me, and (with your permission) I may decide to post it here on the website. Oh, and all of this applies to negative feedback, too. I <em>do</em> want to know how to improve myself and my work.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Offering</strong> a job...</dt>
	<dd>Hey, I can hope, right? I'm currently unemployed, but thankfully, I'm not in desperate need of a job. If you're looking, though, I might be interested. Please, email me so that we can talk about it.</dd>
