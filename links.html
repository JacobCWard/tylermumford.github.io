<p><a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ekdgbodaoampohmhmecigaomnjppbplb'>Goodness</a> is my most successful project to date: a Chrome extension designed to help people overcome pornography addictions. Its goal is to place and keep the user in a positive, uplifting frame of mind.</p>

<p><a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gddhafhbmmbafbfdkgpjfcdkkeifjgga'>MLIx&#772;</a> is a good way to demonstrate one reason why I choose to code. <a href='http://mylifeisaverage.com'>My Life Is Average</a> is a website where people share interesting stories about their lives. It&#8217;s similar to Twitter, but much more humorous. One day, I had the idea to improve the functionality and visual appeal of the site. So I made this Chrome extension to do just that.</p>

<p><a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gdbjnkjeipkapabcodafgjgpdnjhgcbc'>Blue Ray</a> showcases another one of my skills. In addition to programming, I&#8217;m also enthusiastic about graphic design, so I threw together this minimalistic Google Chrome theme. I think it looks pretty good. <small>Anyway, you've probably noticed that almost all of my work is for Chrome, right? Well, that's because anyone who can write web pages with JavaScript can easily learn how to make Chrome extensions.</small></p>

<p><a href='http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=20975.0'>SubDiv</a> was my first real program for Windows. I submitted it as part of the <a href='http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=21276.0'>NANY 2010 challenge</a> on <a href='http://www.donationcoder.com'>DonationCoder.com</a> — a site I highly recommend. For such a small program, it did better than I thought it would (after I fixed an inconvenient bug).</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/tylerwayne/UberType/wiki/Instructions'>ÜberType</a> is last, but certainly not least. I&#8217;ve spent much of the past six years learning German, and I found that umlaut characters are not easy to create on an English keyboard.* This Windows program lets you type Ä, Ö, Ü, and ß very easily, without memorizing tricky keyboard shortcut combinations.</p>
<small>* I have switched to a Mac. Now they're easy as π, which is really easy.</small>
