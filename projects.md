### Active

[Goodness] is my most successful project to date: a Chrome extension designed to help people overcome pornography addictions. It currently has about 11,000 users.

### Upcoming

I've got some app ideas for iOS and Mac. I'll be writing more as I start working on them.

### Old Projects
  
- [MLIx&#772;] is another Chrome extension. It was my attempt to improve the [My Life Is Average] interface.
  
- [Blue Ray] is a spartan, white-and-blue Chrome theme.
  
- [SubDiv] was my first Windows program. An entry in the [NANY 2010] challenge on [DonationCoder.com], it may have proven useful to some, but was eventually abandoned.
  
- [ÜberType] is a tiny Windows utility that lets you type Ä, Ö, Ü, and ß very easily without using tricky shortcuts.
