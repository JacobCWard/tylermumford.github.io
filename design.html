<h2>Effective Design</h2>

<h3>What's It For?</h3>
	<p>
		It's for you. Effective Design is a service (currently only existing in my brain) that gives you a way to make sure your materials, whether for print or screen, are as successful as they can be.
	</p>
<h3>Why Bother?</h3>
	<p>
		As a college student, I see lots of fliers advertising various clubs, events, and other things. But almost all of these posters have poor grammar and unappealing design. I want to help with that, so I had a thought: &ldquo;Would people pay a couple bucks to have someone professionally proofread their paper? Would a club (or church group) think about using a designer to make their poster more eye-catching?&rdquo; Sure.
	</p>
	<p>
		So why not have a simple, inexpensive design company? I love the idea. Do you? Send me an email, long or short, to <a href="mailto:tyler.wayne.dev@gmail.com">tyler.wayne.dev@gmail.com</a> letting me know what you think. As long as I'm not the only one in favor of the concept, I'll get it moving.
