### About Me

My name is Tyler Mumford, and I'm a coder. I make websites, apps, and other complicated things.

All of my published code is (so far) written in my spare time and (so far) freely available. Visit the [Projects] page for a list of my work. I believe programming is an art, and I fancy myself a bit nobler for it.
