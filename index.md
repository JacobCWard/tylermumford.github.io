### About Me
My name is Tyler Wayne, and I'm a coder. I make computer programs, and other complicated things. That's why I created Code Haven — to have a place to publish my code and the code of others.

All of my published code is written in my spare time, with the exception of a few school assignments. Programming is what I love to do, because I believe that it's an art form.

> *"The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs."*
> — Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason

### Guiding Principles

Simplicity is powerful.
