### About Me
My name is Tyler Wayne, and I'm a coder. I make computer programs and other complicated things. That's why I created Code Haven â€” to have a place to talk about my code and the code of others.

All of my published code is written in my spare time and freely available. Visit the [Links] page for a list. I hope to make money eventually, but for now I'm content to simply express myself. (Whoo, that sounds artsy-fartsy.) But honestly, I believe programming is an art, and I fancy myself a bit nobler for it.
